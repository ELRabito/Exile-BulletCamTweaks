# Exile-BulletCam Tweaks/Nerf

# Changes
- Adjusted timings.
- Disabled the ability to shoot from/into territories (Can't use them as raiding tool anymore etc).
- To add something i just added a map marker (useless but i found it somehow interesting).
- Remove the code parts with "BulletCamMarker" if you don't want it (Line 64 - 95).
- If the BulletCAM impacts there is a green marker on the map.
- If out of range there is a red marker at the position were the camera transmission was lost.

# Installation
- 1. Make a CfgExileCustomCode override for ExileClient_system_bulletCam_thread.sqf
- 2. Done
